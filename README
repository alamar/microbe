You need Java Development Kit and Maven.

To run models:

mvn compile

mvn exec:java -Dmodel=<model without .properties>

for example, mvn exec:java -Dmodel=stable-monoploid

It will produce <model>.txt with results as well as printing steps on stdout.

Bulk processing:
for i in `cat seeds.txt`; do mvn exec:java -Dmodel=10-ploid -Dseed=$i; done

bash merge.sh 10-ploid-*.txt > 10-ploids.txt
